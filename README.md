In 2018, Elon Musk’s Tesla stock dropped significantly after Twitter was flooded with tweets about Musk smoking weed during a podcast. NBC news reported ‘Tesla stock plunged 9 percent on Friday after a bizarre podcast in which CEO Elon Musk smoked weed and sipped whiskey, and two high-profile executives abruptly announced they were leaving the company.’
This incident highlighted the importance of an “Investor’s Sentiment” in making or breaking the price of a stock
The ‘Dalaal Street’ model takes into account all the buzz around social media about a particular stock and predicts stock price based on the overall sentiment and what’s in news. 


In this project, we explore how to get the best prediction of the closing value of the stock price of a Company. The model has been built such that it can scrape tweets and news websites to capture any relevant information on the target company in an iterative manner, based on the timestamp when the model is being run. Sentiment analysis is then done on the scraped data to understand the market sentiment for the target company. Based on historical data, the market sentiment and the closing price of the stock on the previous day , the closing stock price for D- day shall be estimated, providing investment opportunities.


This model for stock price prediction can be replicated across multiple companies and help individuals in taking important investment decisions.
